# BRAINSTORM 2
App Idea 1: CampusConnector

What: CampusConnector is an app designed to help connect students with events that're happening around campus.

Who: The app is targeted towards college students who want to participate in more campus events.

Why: We are building this app to give students a chance to find events that're happening near their campus but also give them the platform to post events that they want to host.

Challenges: Potential challenges include mapping post by college.

App Idea 2: NextGrub
What: NextGrub is an app designed for food enthusiasts to find and share their experiences with restaurants and other food spots. It is like a gamified version of OpenTable with the style of BeReal. Users are tasked to submit a photo of themselves trying a new food spot each week and share it to a network of friends.

Who: The app is targeted to people who like to blog their food experiences and those who are willing to try new food spots. 

Why: NextGrub allows users to breakthrough the "gatekeeping" of great food spots. 

Challenges: Apps like Yelp and OpenTable have similar ideas and a solid user base that may be hard to win over.
